Our research is funded by U.S. federal and state grants and fellowships and by private foundations. Right now, it is very challenging to fundraise for research into human impacts on ocean life. Private gifts at all levels make a big difference, and lead directly to new scientific discoveries and to training opportunities for the next generation of STEM leaders. A few hundred dollars can help to pay a research assistant's hourly wages or to send a student to a scientific conference. Larger donations and grants are vital to cover the salaries and research expenses of trainees in the lab. You can [donate directly to our research fund](https://give.ucsc.edu/campaigns/38026/donations/new?designation=fredstonlaboceansciences&) or [contact Dr. Fredston](mailto:fredston@ucsc.edu) about funding opportunities.
