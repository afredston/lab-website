    "section": "Climate biogeography",
    "text": "Climate biogeography\nSpecies around the globe are shifting their ranges in response to climate change, reshuffling ecosystems and challenging paradigms of natural management. Yet species’ range shifts are highly variable, perhaps because many ecological and environmental processes besides climate also influence species distributions. Without understanding these other processes and how they interact with one another and with climate, it’s difficult to predict range shifts and make management recommendations. We work to advance our mechanistic understanding of processes that govern species distributions in the Anthropocene, and consequently, our ability to forecast those distributions. Recent and ongoing work in the lab on this topic has:\n\nSynthesized published literature and historical reports to build a &gt;100-year time-series of range extensions by marine invertebrates in California, finding that they are highly associated with El Niño and the 2014-2016 large marine heatwave (Sevigny et al., In review).\nProposed a new theory to describe “species on the move” responding to global change via temperature gradients experienced both in space and in time, and at various scales from micro to meso to macro (Fredston, Tingley, et al. 2025).\nDug into what geographical ranges actually are, and how to tell if they are shifting (Fredston, preprint).\nTested the degree to which range edges of temperate marine fishes are tracking temperature change (Fredston-Hermann et al. 2020, Fredston et al. 2021).\nDescribed how marine protected areas can be designed to accommodate future range-shifting species (Fredston-Hermann et al. 2018)."

    "text": "Cumulative human impacts on marine ecosystems\nClimate change may transform ecosystems through not only the “press” of gradual warming but also the “pulse” of extreme events like heatwaves. Further, sustainable oceans require managing other human impacts, including runoff and fishing. Runoff—the direct influx of sediments, nutrients, and other forms of pollution carried to coastal oceans from rivers—directly threatens sensitive habitats that are crucial to biodiversity conservation, like coral reefs and seagrass beds. Well-managed fisheries could provide protein with a low greenhouse gas footprint to billions of people and support livelihoods in countless coastal communities. Unfortunately, many fisheries in the world are associated with problematic social or ecological outcomes—or both. We engage with these issues both through primary research and through collaboration and outreach with stakeholders. Past work on this topic includes:\n\nFinding that demersal marine fish communities do not exhibit a consistent response to marine heatwaves (Fredston et al. 2023) and also do not exhibit consistent biotic homogenization in the face of climate change (Kitchel et al. 2025).\nDeveloping operational tools for land-sea management, particularly in data-limited settings (Brown et al. 2019, Fredston-Hermann et al. 2016).\n\nCollaborating with economists to demonstrate that the biogeographical dynamics of high-value fishery target species like tunas influence whether it is profitable to harvest them to extinction (Burgess et al. 2017)."

Beyond the lab, Dr. Fredston has contributed extensively to collaborations aimed at making it easier for the field to do impactful science, from demystifying climate scenarios for marine ecology audiences (Burgess et al. 2023) to building a data infrastructure that standardized dozens of publicly-available bottom trawl surveys from around the world (Maureaud et al. 2024) and created an international community of practice around trawl data (Maureaud et al. 2025). She has also written about the challenges and opportunities that the open science movement presents to the marine sciences, especially for early-career scientists (Fredston and Lowndes 2024)."

Right now, it is very challenging to fundraise for research into human impacts on ocean life. Private gifts at all levels make a big difference, and lead directly to new scientific discoveries and to training opportunities for the next generation of STEM leaders. A few hundred dollars can help to pay a research assistant’s hourly wages or to send a student to a scientific conference. Larger donations and grants are vital to cover the salaries and research expenses of trainees in the lab. You can donate directly to our research fund or contact Dr. Fredston about funding opportunities."

Strong support exists for interdisciplinary work and partnerships, via the Institute for Marine Sciences, NOAA’s Southwest Fishery Science Center, and more. Prospective graduate students are encouraged to explore the Ocean Sciences prospective student page, including the program prerequisites listed here.\nThe Fredston Lab is a computational group that develops and tests hypotheses about the fundamental dynamics of marine ecosystems using theoretical models and Bayesian and frequentist statistics. Successful Fredston Lab members are likely to have an extensive background in math, programming, and statistics; an enthusiasm for oceanography, quantitative ecology, coding, and open science; evidence of independent leadership in projects (via publications, life experiences, or past research); and a genuine commitment to collaboration and interaction within and beyond the lab. Data reuse and synthesis are at the core of our research program. We do not have a field or a lab program and do not collect primary ecological data.\nDr. Fredston is always open to co-developing proposals for fellowships and other externally funded positions. These opportunities are too numerous and rapidly-changing to list, but feel free to contact Dr. Fredston to discuss specific ones you have identified. We also sometimes advertise funded positions for students and postdocs. In 2025-26, we are hiring a postdoc for Bayesian modeling of humpback whales.\nAll prospective lab members should email Dr. Fredston directly, unless you are applying for an advertised postdoc, in which case please use the UCSC job application website instead. You should include the following in your email:\n\nA short summary (one paragraph or less) of your background and career goals.\nA short summary (one paragraph or less) of why you want to come to UCSC, and to the Fredston lab specifically.\nA short summary (one paragraph or less) of a project you are interested in working on. (This is not binding in any way, but will give Dr. Fredston a sense of what you are excited about and how you think. You can alternatively send a research proposal you’ve written, like an NSF GRFP application.)\nYour current CV. Prospective graduate students should also attach all relevant unofficial transcripts and confirm in the email text that they meet the prerequisites for Ocean Sciences at UCSC.\n\nThis great guide to emailing prospective PhD advisers by Dr. Hart at UNSW is worth reading, too (and if it’s paywalled for you just let Dr. Fredston know and she will send you a copy)."
